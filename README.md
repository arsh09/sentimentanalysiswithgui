# sentimentanalysiswithgui
This python script takes the tweets using Twitter API (tweepy) and performs a sentiment analysis. Apart from that, you can manually enter text in the text box and it will return the sentiment of the text.

For easier use, I made a basic GUI using Tkinter.

NOTE: This script was written around 2016, and I understand that Twitter has changed its API after it so it might need an update on that side. However, the sentiment analysis on the text works like a charm.
